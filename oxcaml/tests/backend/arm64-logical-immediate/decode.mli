(** Decode ARM64 logical immediate encoding to 64-bit value *)

(** [decode_logical_immediate ~n ~immr ~imms] decodes an ARM64 logical
    immediate encoding into the corresponding 64-bit value.

    The encoding uses three fields:
    - [n]: 1-bit field distinguishing 64-bit patterns (typically 1 for 64-bit, 0 for 32-bit)
    - [immr]: 6-bit rotation amount
    - [imms]: 6-bit field encoding element size and run length

    The decoded value is constructed by:
    1. Determining the element size (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits)
    2. Creating a pattern with consecutive 1-bits
    3. Rotating the pattern within the element
    4. Replicating the element across 64 bits

    @raise Invalid_argument if the encoding is invalid (e.g., all zeros or all ones pattern)
*)
val decode_logical_immediate : n:int -> immr:int -> imms:int -> Nativeint.t
